Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Systems with Applications in Autonomous Driving
Reinforcement learning control has lively echoes in the control communities recently.
However, due to the absence of safety guarantee, the corresponding application is still far from safety-critical scenarios, e.g., autonomous vehicles, aerospace engineering and human interactive robots. 
Motivated by the need of simultaneously enhancing the control performance and safety guarantee, our project aims to compare reinforcement learning controller and model predictive controller horizontally and further validate the reinforcement learning performance under the guarantee
of control barrier function.
Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the aforementioned method.
